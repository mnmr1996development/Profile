            <h4>Project Description:</h4>
            <p class="projectdescription">The purpose of this project was to demonstrate machine learning practices commonly used today. My college colleauge and I designed a video game similar to asteroids where the user would have to avoid all the incoming rocks and had a neural network figure out how to play the game from scratch.</p>
            <p>The First 6 iterations demonstartes when the neural network was moving at random</p>
            <p>The 104th iteration demonstartes when it started picking up some patterns</p>
            <p>AT the 643rd generation (timestamp 1:47) the best ship in the generation is able to survive for over 3 minutes</p>

            </video>
            <p>Disclaimer: traditionally this would train a lot faster and a lot better but this was done using a windows integrated graphics laptop instead of a tradition GPU, this was the maximum runnable settings of 300 ships in a generation before the program got way too slow</p>

            <h4>Project Description:</h4>
            <p class="projectdescription">Compilers are one of the most underappreciated parts of modern programming that we have,
               they scan the code for keywords, tokenize everything and store important information like variables. 
               In the project I used the java programming language to write some of the basic functionalites of a pascal
              compiler. down below is a video showing off most of the functionalites that are listed</p>
            <h4>Functionalites that work:</h4>
            <ul id="pascal">
              <li>basic arithmethic</li>

            <p class="projectdescription">The purpose of this project was to have a front end java application connected to a backend
               server, unfortanetly the configuration for the backend got lost when I switched laptops but the code connecting the two
                still works along with the front-end</p>

            <p class="projectdescription">The purpose of this project was to use react and connect it with the
              phaser 3 engine to develop a multiplayer game. We worked in a group of 5 using the 
              agile scrum method of weekly meetings and constant code or markup output by each member in 
              the group.

            <h4>Project Description:</h4>
            <p class="projectdescription">In this project, we looked at the share of crimes of each district in the city of New York. New York is a big and a very diverse
               city in the united states. Crime is something troubling for everyday New Yorkers. To make police deployment more effective in crime 
               prevention, pinpointing the most crime riddled area is helpful. Therefore, in this project we analyze different crimes in the city with
                the corresponding areas where they are mostly committed. We made available to the user each crimes in a simple and clear visualization. 
                We have three different type of visualizations. We are interpreting the data on a map, in a scatter plot, and in a bubble chart.The user
                 will be able to spot the predominant type of crime in a specific district.

               the x86 Assembly language. I had to run it using DOSBOX and downloading TASM on
                my windows parition of my laptop but this was written all using the notepad++ text editor from scratch</p>

              but I added another row to it so I ended up calling it GAME 19 but the purpose of the game is to
              get all the numbers in order in as little moves as possible. there's a counter to record moves, a shuffle button,
              a button to see the solved bored, arrow key movement buttons, and a button to exit the game
